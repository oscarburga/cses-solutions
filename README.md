# CSES Problemset Solutions
My solutions to CSES problemset. I will probably (not) solve the remaining problems/categories at some point.

PD: This is all old competitive programming code written on raw vim with no plugins. Formatting is very "questionable" and code is not pretty, but at the time my priorities were "less keystrokes, less characters, less formatting, faster typing".
