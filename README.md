# CSES Problemset Solutions
My solutions to [CSES problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/). I will probably (not) solve the remaining problems/categories at some point.

As of august 15th 2023, this repository contains the solutions to the complete Dynamic Programming, Range Queries and Geometry categories. It also contains passing solutions to all but 4 problems of the string category, most of the graph category, almost the entire second half of the tree algorithms category, and a couple of the advanced techniques problems (treap problems).

PD: This is all old competitive programming code written on raw vim with no plugins. Formatting is very "questionable" and code is not pretty, but at the time my priorities were "less keystrokes, less characters, less formatting, faster typing".
